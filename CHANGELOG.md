# Waterline Changelog

### 0.11.3

* [BUG] Fix auto-updating attributes to take into account custom column names. See [#1360](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline/pull/1360) for more details. Thanks to [@jenjenut233](https://github.com/jenjenut233) for the patch!   Also fixes https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/issues/3821.

### 0.11.2

* [BUG] Fix #1326

* [BUG] Fix issues with compatibility in `alter` auto-migrations. This was causing corrupted data depending on the permutation of adapter version and Waterline version. This should be fixed in the SQL adapters that support the new `select` query modifier.

* [ENHANCEMENT] Updated dependencies to remove warning messages when installing.

### 0.12.1

* [BUG] Fixes an issue when searching by `id` in schemaless mode. See [#1326](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline/issues/1326) for more details.

### 0.12.0

* [Enhancement] Allows attribute definitions to contain a `meta` property that will be passed down to the adapter. This allows arbitrary information about an attribute to be passed down to interactions on the physical storage engine. Going forward any adapter specific migration information should be sent via the `meta` property. See [#1306](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline/pull/1306) for more information.

* [Enhancement] Allows for the use of `.select()` to build out projections in both top level queries and association queries. See [#1310](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline/pull/1310) for more details and examples.

* [Enhancement] Allow for the ability to pass in extra data to an adapter function using the `.meta()` option. This could be used for a variety of things inside custom adapters such as passing connections around for transactions or passing config values for muti-tenant functionality. For more details see [#1325](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline/pull/1325).

### 0.11.0

* [BREAKING CHANGE] Removed the second argument from `.save()` commands that returns the newly updated data that has been re-populated. This should increase performance and limit memory. See [#1295](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline/pull/1295) for more details.
