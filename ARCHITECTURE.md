# How Waterline Works


## High-Level Diagram

## Overview: Talking to the database

There are two different approaches for talking to the database using Waterline.

### Waterline queries

The first, and simplest, is by building and executing a **Waterline query** -- most commonly by calling a model method to get a chainable deferred object:

```js
User.find()
.where({
  occupation: 'doctor'
})
.omit('occupation')
.limit(30)
.skip(90)
.sort('name asc')
.exec(function (err, userRecords){

});
```

### Statements

The second, lower-level approach to talking to your database with Waterline is to build and execute a **statement** -- most commonly by calling a datastore method:

```js
sails.datastore('mysql').sendStatement({
  select: ['*'],
  from: 'inventory',
  where: {
    type: 'snack'
  }
}).exec(function (err, result) {

});
```

> Statements expect you to use column names, not attribute names.




## Querying (implementation)

When you run a query in Waterline, the data structure goes through 5 different stages.

### Stage 1 query

> _aka "Query instance" / "deferred object"_

Stage 1 queries are Query instances; i.e. the deferred object you get from calling a model method.

For example:
```
var q = User.findOne({
  omit: 'occupation',
  where: {
    occupation: 'doctor'
  },
  skip: 90,
  sort: 'name asc'
}).populate('friends', {
  where: {
    occupation: 'doctor'
  },
  sort: 'yearsInIndustry DeSc'
});
```


### Stage 2 query

> _aka "logical protostatement"_

Under the covers, when you call `.exec()`, Waterline expands the stage 1 query into a dictionary (i.e. plain JavaScript object).

This is what's known as a "Phase 2 query":

```js
{
  method: 'findOne', // << the name of the method
  using: 'user', // << the identity of the model

  // The criteria dictionary
  // (because this is "find"/"findOne", "update", "destroy", "count", "sum", or "avg")
  criteria: {

    // The expanded "select" clause
    // (note that because we specified an explicit `select` or `omit`, this gets expanded in a schema-aware way.
    // For no projections, this is `select: ['*']`.  And `select` is NEVER allowed to be `[]`.)
    select: [
      'id',
      'name',
      'age',
      'createdAt',
      'updatedAt'
    ],

    // The expanded "where" clause
    where: {
      and: [
        { occupation: 'doctor' }
      ]
    },

    // The "limit" clause (if there is one, otherwise defaults to `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`)
    limit: 9007199254740991,

    // The "skip" clause (if there is one, otherwise defaults to 0)
    skip: 0,

    // The expanded "sort" clause
    sort: [
      { name: 'ASC' }
    ]
  },

  // The `populates` clause.
  // (if nothing was populated, this would be empty.)
  populates: {

    friends: {
      select: [ '*' ],
      where: {
        occupation: 'doctor'
      },
      limit: Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER,
      skip: 0,
      sort: 'yearsInIndustry DESC'
    }

  }

}
```


### Stage 3 query

> _aka "physical protostatement"_


Next, Waterline performs a couple of additional transformations:

+ replaces `method: 'findOne'` with `method: 'find'` (and updates `limit` accordingly)
+ replaces attribute names with column names
+ replaces the model identity with the table name
+ removed `populates` (or potentially replaced it with `joins`)
  + this varies-- keep in mind that sometimes _multiple physical protostatements will be built up and sent to different adapters_-- or even the same one.
  + if `joins` is added, then this would replace `method: 'findOne'` or `method: 'find'` with `method: 'join'`.

```js
{
  method: 'find', //<< note that "findOne" was replaced with "find"
  using: 'users', //<< the table name
  criteria: {
    select: [
      'id',
      'full_name',
      'age',
      'created_at',
      'updated_at'
    ],
    where: {
      and: [
        { occupation_key: 'doctor' }
      ]
    },
    limit: 2,//<< note that this was set to `2` automatically
    skip: 90,
    sort: [
      { full_name: 'ASC' }
    ]
  }
}
```

This physical protostatement is what gets sent to the database adapter.



> Note that, in some cases, **multiple different physical protostatements** will be built up, and sent to the same or different adapters.

For example, if Waterline decides that it is a good idea (based on the variety of logical query
this is, which datastores it spans, and the support implemented in adapters), then it will transform
the method to `join`, and provide additional info:

```js
{
  method: 'join', //<< note that "findOne" was replaced with "join"
  using: 'users', //<< the table name
  criteria: {
    select: [
      'id',
      'full_name',
      'age',
      'created_at',
      'updated_at'
    ],
    where: {
      and: [
        { occupation_key: 'doctor' }
      ]
    },
    limit: 2,//<< note that this was STILL set to `2` automatically
    skip: 90,
    sort: [
      { full_name: 'ASC' }
    ],

    // If `method` is `join`, then join instructions will be included in the criteria:
    joins: [
      // TODO: document `joins`
    ]
  },
}
```



### Stage 4 query

> _aka "statement"_

In the database adapter, the physical protostatement is converted into an actual _statement_:

```js
{
  from: 'users',
  select: [
    'id',
    'full_name',
    'age',
    'created_at',
    'updated_at'
  ],
  where: {
    and: [
      { occupation_key: 'doctor' }
    ]
  },
  limit: 2,
  skip: 90,
  sort: [
    { full_name: 'ASC' }
  ]
}
```

This is the same kind of statement that you can send directly to the lower-level driver.  Statements are _much_ closer to native queries (e.g. SQL query or MongoDB native queries).  They are still more or less database-agnostic, but less regimented, and completely independent from the database schema.



### Stage 5 query

> _aka "native query"_

In the database driver, the statement is compiled into a native query:

```js
SELECT id, full_name, age, created_at, updated_at FROM users WHERE occupation_key="doctor" LIMIT 2 SKIP 90 SORT full_name ASC;
```











## Validating/normalizing a criteria's `where` clause

#### If key is `and` or `or`...
Then this is a predicate operator that should have an array on the RHS.

#### For any other key...

The key itself must be a valid attr name or column name (depending on if this is a stage 2 or stage 3 query).

The meaning of the RHS depends on its type:

=> string, number, boolean, or null
 => indicates an equality filter

=> array
  => indicates shortcut notation for "IN"
  => (should be normalized into `{in: ['...']}` automatically -- never allowed if expecting it to already be normalized)

=> dictionary
  => indicates a subattribute modifier
  => The type expectation for the dictionary itself varies.
  => (but note that `{'!':[...]}` should be normalized into `{nin: ['...']}` automatically -- never allowed if expecting it to already be normalized)

=> misc
  => never allowed




Examples:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

{ occupation: 'doctor' },
{ occupation: 23523 },
{ occupation: null },
{ occupation: true },
{ occupation: false },
{ occupation: false },

{ occupation: { not: 'doctor' } },
{ occupation: { not: 23523 } },
{ occupation: { not: null } },
{ occupation: { not: true } },
{ occupation: { not: false } },

{ occupation: { in: ['doctor', 'nurse'] } },
{ occupation: { in: [true, false, 283523, null] } },

{ occupation: { nin: ['doctor', 'nurse'] } },
{ occupation: { nin: [true, false, 283523, null] } },

{ occupation: { contains: 'asdf' } },
{ occupation: { like: 'asdf' } },
{ occupation: { startsWith: 'asdf' } },
{ occupation: { endsWith: 'asdf' } },
