Before you submit an issue for Waterline, please make sure you have read the Sails issue contribution guide (http://bit.ly/sails-issue-guide) carefully, and then verify the following by typing an X in between each set of [ ] brackets below (don't make any other changes to the text!):

### BEGIN PLEDGE ###
- [ ] I am experiencing a concrete technical issue with Waterline (ideas and feature proposals should follow the guide for proposing features and enhancements (http://bit.ly/sails-feature-guide), which involves making a pull request).  If you're not 100% certain whether it's a bug or not, that's okay--you may continue.  The worst that can happen is that the issue will be closed and we'll point you in the right direction.

- [ ] I am not asking a question about how to use Waterline or about whether or not Waterline has a certain feature (please refer to the documentation(http://sailsjs.org), or post on http://stackoverflow.com, our Google Group (http://bit.ly/sails-google-group) or our live chat (https://gitter.im/balderdashy/sails).

- [ ] I have already searched for related issues, and found none open (if you found a related _closed_ issue, please link to it in your post).

- [ ] My issue title is concise, on-topic and polite.

and finally...
- [ ] **I can provide steps to reproduce this issue that others can follow.**

Ideally, this involves creating a new repo that demonstrates the problem (see instructions at http://bit.ly/waterline-issue-repo).  Even though your issue may seem so simple to reproduce that a new repo is unnecessary, you'd be surprised how many solutions present themselves when you start from `sails new` and attempt to recreate your issue from scratch in a new app.  This ensures that the real issue isn't in your user code or in a third-party module.  If you're absolutely _convinced_ that a new repo is unnecessary, provide clear, concise and _specific_ steps to reproduce the problem in your post (not "create a model then do blueprint create").
### END PLEDGE ###
