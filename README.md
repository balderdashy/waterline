Waterline is a next-generation storage and retrieval engine, and the default ORM used in the [Sails framework](https://sailsjs.com).

It provides a uniform API for accessing stuff from different kinds of [databases and protocols](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/adapters/available-adapters). That means you write the same code to get and store things like users, whether they live in MySQL, MongoDB, neDB, or Postgres.

Waterline strives to inherit the best parts of ORMs like ActiveRecord, Hibernate, and Mongoose, but with a fresh perspective and emphasis on modularity, testability, and consistency across adapters.

## No more callbacks

Starting with v0.13, Waterline takes full advantage of ECMAScript & Node 8's `await` keyword.

**In other words, [no more callbacks](https://gist.github.com/mikermcneil/c1028d000cc0cc8bce995a2a82b29245).**

```js
var newOrg = await Organization.create({
  slug: 'foo'
})
.fetch();
```

> Looking for the version of Waterline used in Sails v0.12?  See the [0.11.x branch](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline/tree/0.11.x) of this repo.  If you're upgrading to v0.13 from a previous release of Waterline _standalone_, take a look at the [upgrading guide](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/upgrading/to-v-1-0).

## Installation
Install from NPM.

```bash
  $ npm install waterline
```

## Overview
Waterline uses the concept of an adapter to translate a predefined set of methods into a query that can be understood by your data store. Adapters allow you to use various datastores such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc. and have a clear API for working with your model data.

Waterline supports [a wide variety of adapters](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/adapters/available-adapters), both core and community maintained.

## Usage

The up-to-date documentation for Waterline is maintained on the [Sails framework website](http://sailsjs.com).
You can find detailed API reference docs under [Reference > Waterline ORM](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/waterline-orm).  For conceptual info (including Waterline standalone usage), and answers to common questions, see [Concepts > Models & ORM](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/models-and-orm).
